# claude-skills

A collection of [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) skills and subagents I build and maintain, kept here so they can be versioned and shared openly. Each skill lives in its own directory with a `SKILL.md`; subagents live under [`agents/`](./agents); some bundle scripts, evals, or reference files.

All skills here are MIT licensed (see [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE)). Skills that wrap an external tool or service carry a **Provenance** note in their `SKILL.md` crediting the upstream project and its license — the MIT license covers the skill content, not the wrapped tools.

## Agents

Subagents for software-development work, coordinated by the `dev-fleet` skill. Each is a `*.md` with frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `tools`, `model`) and a system-prompt body. Architecture and rationale: [`docs/agent-fleet-architecture.md`](./docs/agent-fleet-architecture.md).

| Agent | Role | Model |
|---|---|---|
| [azure-architect](./agents/azure-architect.md) | Enterprise-scale Azure / Cloud Adoption Framework design — governance, subscriptions, networking, IaC review | opus |
| [fact-verifier](./agents/fact-verifier.md) | Verify claims/code against authoritative sources — cite, refute, or return the lookup; never assert from memory | sonnet |
| [code-builder](./agents/code-builder.md) | Implement scoped changes TDD-style in an isolated worktree; commit on a branch, never push/merge/apply | sonnet |
| [coherence-checker](./agents/coherence-checker.md) | Structural fit of the implementation vs the plan/spec/verified facts — spec/plan traceability, inverse-pair round-trip (no normalization tricks), cross-impl parity, contract-docstring fidelity; read-only, gated on change complexity | sonnet |
| [code-reviewer](./agents/code-reviewer.md) | Advisory review for correctness, edge cases, contracts, security, tests — findings, not a gate | sonnet |
| [docs-reviewer](./agents/docs-reviewer.md) | Review docs (READMEs, ADRs, runbooks) for completeness, clarity, correctness, and audience fit | sonnet |
| [ux-auditor](./agents/ux-auditor.md) | Audit a rendered web page for usability/accessibility; renders via agent-browser/playwright-cli, fans out one per page (reads `ux-audit`) | sonnet |
| [commit-pr](./agents/commit-pr.md) | Write commit and PR/MR messages (reads `commit-style`) | haiku |
| [commit-style](./agents/commit-style.md) | Commit/PR style playbook used by `commit-pr` | — |

Several agents ship a deterministic behavioral eval under `agents/<name>/evals/` (run with `uv run python grade.py`).

## Contributing

Authoring or editing a skill? See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) — in particular the
**absolute-path + uv convention** for invoking a skill's bundled scripts, so they work from any
working directory rather than only this repo's root.

## Install

Symlink any skill into your personal skills directory:

```bash
ln -s "$(pwd)/clear-and-human" ~/.claude/skills/clear-and-human
```

Subagents install the same way, into `~/.claude/agents/`:

```bash
ln -s "$(pwd)/agents/fact-verifier.md" ~/.claude/agents/fact-verifier.md
```

Symlinking (rather than copying) keeps this repo the single source of truth — edits here are picked up immediately.

### Requirements per skill

- **c7search** — the `c7search` binary (`go install github.com/kevin-burns/c7search@latest`). A `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` is optional.
- **markdown-converter** — `uv` (uses `uvx markitdown`, no install needed).
- **nano-banana-pro-json** — `uv` and a `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable. No key is bundled.
- **convert-to-webp** — `cwebp` (`brew install webp`) or macOS `sips`. No install needed on macOS.
- **social-image-prep** — `sips` (macOS), ImageMagick, or `uv` (for the Pillow fallback). Uses whichever is present.
- **terragrunt-skill** — works as static review with no tooling; the bundled `scripts/validate.sh` uses `terragrunt` (1.0.x), plus optional `tflint` and `trivy` if present. `scripts/detect_custom_resources.py` runs on Python 3.
- **terraform-registry** — Python 3 (stdlib only). `search`/`inspect-module` need only network access; `inspect-resource`/`refresh-schema` additionally need the `terraform` CLI.
- **source-snapshot** — Python 3 (stdlib only). Uses whichever extractor is present: `markitdown` (via `uv`, the reliable fallback for docs/tables), and optionally Defuddle for prose articles (it strips page chrome). The producer auto-resolves the Defuddle runner — an installed `defuddle` binary, else `pnpm dlx` / `bunx` / `npx defuddle` (the `defuddle` package; `defuddle-cli` is deprecated/merged into it) — never pinning `@latest`, so caches are reused. Install once with `pnpm add -g defuddle` to avoid per-run fetches, or set `SNAPSHOT_DEFUDDLE_CMD` for a custom path. Degrades gracefully when one is missing.
- **cv-and-human** — no tooling for the core workflow (review, tailoring, de-slop). The optional red-team's measured ATS lens uses `scripts/ats_adversarial_loop.py` — `uv`/Python 3 (its `selftest` runs without a model backend).
- **dev-fleet** — no tooling; it's an orchestration playbook for the agents above.
- **report-builder** — `uv` (the bundled `scripts/render.py` declares its deps via PEP 723 inline metadata; run with `uv run`). Bootstrap/Chart.js/Plotly load from CDN, or vendor them for offline reports.
- **ux-audit / ux-auditor** — a browser driver to render pages: prefers `agent-browser`, falls back to `playwright-cli`; uses whichever is installed. Degrades to a static-HTML audit (clearly flagged) if neither is present.
- **azadvertizer** — `uv` (stdlib-only script via `uv run`); network only for the one-time `fetch`. Caches to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/azadvertizer`; all queries run offline. Data © Julian Hayward / [AzAdvertizer](https://www.azadvertizer.net) — cache, don't hammer; not republished here.
